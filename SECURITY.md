# Security Guidelines

## Sensitive Files Audit Status: ‚úÖ CLEAN

This repository has been audited for sensitive files and follows security best practices.

## Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Current Good Practices
- [x] Environment variables used for sensitive configuration (JWT_SECRET, MONGO_URI)
- [x] `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files (.env, .env.*, etc.)
- [x] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in source code
- [x] Authentication code properly references environment variables
- [x] No committed `.env` files or similar sensitive configuration files

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines for Contributors

#### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files or files containing actual secrets
- Use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` for all sensitive configuration
- Required environment variables:
  - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
  - `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string
  - `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)
  - `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` - CORS origin (optional)

#### File Patterns to Avoid Committing
- `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.
- Files named with `secret`, `key`, `credential`, `password`
- Configuration files with hardcoded sensitive values
- Database dumps or backups
- SSL certificates or private keys

#### Before Committing
1. Check that `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
2. Search your changes for hardcoded secrets: `git diff | grep -i "password\|secret\|key"`
3. Ensure all sensitive values use environment variables

### üîí Environment Setup
1. Copy environment variables from your deployment platform (Render, etc.)
2. Create local `.env` file for development (this file is gitignored)
3. Never share `.env` files through chat, email, or public channels

### üìã Regular Security Checks
- Review `.gitignore` when adding new sensitive file types
- Audit codebase periodically for hardcoded secrets
- Rotate secrets if they may have been exposed
- Use tools like `git-secrets` or similar for automated scanning
